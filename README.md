# Asset Sentiment Analysis Platform (ASAP)

## Project Description

The Asset Sentiment Analysis Platform, or ASAP, is an application designed to allow users the ability to track and follow various financial assets (stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.). Assets can be added to a user's watchlist, which will allow for them to receive news and price updates on their dashboard. Additionally, users are able to perform online sentiment analysis on a chosen asset that will query social media APIS (such as Reddit and Twitter) for mentions of an asset or its symbol. The content of online posts about the asset can be given a bullish, bearish, or neutral rating based upon the analyzed sentiment, which is performed by AWS Comprehend. This will allow for users to be able to stay on top of retail investor sentiment for their favorite assets to aid them in anticipating market moves.

- git clone https://github.com/revature-asap/asap-ui.git

The following are AnglulerCLI commands for starting the server and running tests

* Development server (Need Angular CLI for running the command)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

* Code scaffolding (Need Angular CLI for running the command)

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

* Build (Need Angular CLI for running the command)

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

* Running unit tests (Need Angular CLI for running the command)

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

* Running end-to-end tests (Need Angular CLI for running the command)

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
   
You can use either of the two following commands to locally host the project:

- ng serve (will only run the serve command)
- npm start (will run asap-ui@<version> start and ng serve)

These commands will allow you to hit the webpage from localhost:4200
All service files will be hitting the hosted project. In order to hit your own hosted project or a local project, the URLs will need to be changed in the service files below to the local url:
